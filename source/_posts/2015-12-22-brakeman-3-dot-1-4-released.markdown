Brakeman Pi!

_Changes since 3.1.3_:

* Emit Brakeman's native fingerprints for Code Climate engine ([Noah Davis](https://github.com/noahd1))
* Ignore `secrets.yml` if in .gitignore ([#777](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/777))
* Work around `safe_yaml` error ([#778](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/778))
* Increase test coverage for option parsing ([Zander Mackie](https://github.com/Zanadar))
* Clean up Ruby warnings ([Andy Waite](https://github.com/andyw8))

### Code Climate Fingerprints

The output format for Code Climate has been updated to include warning fingerprints as generated by Brakeman.

### Ignored secrets.yml

If `secrets.yml` is ignored via `.gitignore`, Brakeman will ignore it, too.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/781))

### Safe YAML Error

For some people, in some cases, `date` is not loaded prior to loading `safe_yaml`. This release ensures `date` is loaded before using SafeYAML and only loads `safe_yaml` on demand.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/782))

### Test Coverage and Warning Cleanup

Thanks to Zander Mackie for improving test coverage (up to 91.24%) by writing tests for the command line options and thanks to Andy Waite for cleaning up various Ruby warnings.
