# Brakeman Site

This is the code for building https://brakemanscanner.org

## Development

The site is built using (a very old version of) Octopress, which is a layer on top of Jekyll.

Changes to the site content should be made in `source/`. Markdown is preferred.

To build:

* Use Ruby 1.9.3
* `bundle install` for dependencies
* To preview: `rake preview` and visit http://localhost:4000
